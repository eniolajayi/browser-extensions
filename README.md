This repository contains code I wrote while learning how to build browser extensions. I used [Google Chrome Extension Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devguide/) as a reference to learn about the basics of browser extensions and the Chrome API. 

## What's Included
Currently:
- A basic "Hello World" browser extension
- An example that inserts a new element on the page.
- An example that simplifies the styling of the current page

I will update this README as I keep learning more about browser extensions

# Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A web browser, such as Google Chrome, to test the extensions

## How to load the extension in your browser
- Download the repo
- Open Google Chrome
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Enable Developer mode in the top right corner
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder for the desired extension in the repository
